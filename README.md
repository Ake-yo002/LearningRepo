Maintainability : Well-engineered software is easier to maintain, update, and extend, reducing long-term costs and ensuring the software's longevity.


2.Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering. 

Mastering Complexity (1960s-1970s):
Early software projects faced significant challenges in managing the increasing complexity of large systems. This era saw the emergence of structured programming, modular design, and data abstraction, laying the foundation for managing software complexity.

Mastering Process (1980s-1990s):
The focus shifted to establishing formal software development processes. Methodologies like the Waterfall model and the Capability Maturity Model (CMM) were introduced to improve project management, quality control, and predictability.

Mastering Change (2000s-Present):
The rise of the internet, mobile computing, and agile methodologies emphasized the need for software that could adapt to rapid change. Agile practices like Scrum and Kanban enabled iterative development, continuous integration, and frequent releases, allowing software to evolve quickly.


3.List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and systems requirements.

Design: Creating high level and detailed designs of the software architechure and user interface.

Implementation: Writing the codes and building the software according to design specifications.

Testing : Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements .

Deployment: This is the phase where the software is released to the users and customers.

Maintenance: Providing ongoing support ,updates and enhancements to the software after the deployment.


4.Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall Methodology:
A linear, sequential approach where each phase is completed before moving to the next.   
Suitable for projects with well-defined requirements, stable technologies, and low risk of changes.
Examples: Safety-critical systems, embedded systems, and large-scale infrastructure projects.

Agile Methodology: 
An iterative and incremental approach that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback.   
Suitable for projects with evolving requirements, high uncertainty, and rapid change.
Examples: Web applications, mobile apps, and software startups.
Agile is not a silver bullet. It requires a high level of team discipline and customer involvement.


5.Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer :
-Designs, develops, and maintains software applications.
-Writes clean, efficient, and well-documented code.
-Collaborates with team members to implement software solutions.
-Debugs and troubleshoots software issues.

Quality Assurance Engineer :
-Develops and executes test plans and test cases.
-Identifies and reports software defects.
-Ensures software meets quality standards and requirements.
-Automates testing processes.

Project Manager:
-Plans, organizes, and oversees software projects.
-Manages project scope, schedule, and budget.
-Communicates with stakeholders and team members.
-Ensures project deliverables are met.

6.Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software platform that facilitates the creation of other software applications by providing a space to write, compile, and debug code, sometimes with value-adding tools that reduce development efforts. eg Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
Importance:
Programming languages have rules for how statements must be structured. Because an IDE knows these rules, it contains many intelligent features for automatically writing or editing the source code.
An IDE can format the written text by automatically making some words bold or italic, or by using different font colors. These visual cues make the source code more readable and give instant feedback about accidental syntax errors.
an IDE can make suggestions to complete a code statement when the developer begins typing.
IDEs increase programmer productivity by performing repeatable development tasks that are typically part of every code change. The following are some examples of regular coding tasks that an IDE carries out.
An IDE compiles or converts the code into a simplified language that the operating system can understand. - Some programming languages implement just-in-time compiling, in which the IDE converts human-readable code into machine code from within the application.
The IDE allows developers to automate unit tests locally before the software is integrated with other developers' code and more complex integration tests are run.
Debugging IDE enables a step through the code, line by line, as it runs and inspect code behavior. IDEs also integrate several debugging tools that highlight bugs caused by human error in real time, even as the developer is typing.

Version Control Systems (VCS) - They are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members. eg Git
Importance:
Collaboration: Enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase without conflicts.
Change Tracking: Records detailed history of changes, allowing easy analysis of each modification. 
Branching and Merging: Supports creating branches for new features and merging them back into the main code.
Error Recovery: Allows reverting to previous versions if new changes introduce errors

7. What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Rapid technological advancement places considerable pressure on software engineers to stay current.
 Solution: adopting continuous learning practices and using agile methodologies to adapt to emerging trends, keeping their skills sharp in an ever-evolving industry. 
 
Time Constraints - Software engineering is a demanding and time-intensive field, often requiring engineers to work under high pressure to meet tight deadlines.
 Solution: adopt agile methodologies, such as Scrum, to streamline workflows by dividing large projects into manageable sprints 
 
Limited Infrastructure - limited high-performance software engineering tools and computing platforms and inefficient data storage architectures. 
Solution: Software engineers must rely heavily on a robust infrastructure to perform their jobs effectively.
 
Changing Software Requirements - Software requirements are often dynamic and subject to frequent changes, making it challenging for engineers to design and develop solutions that meet users' needs while accounting for future updates and bug fixes. 
Solution: engineers can adopt approaches like agile development, which emphasizes iterative progress and adaptability, and modular design, which enables flexibility by breaking systems into manageable, independent components.

Software Security - Programming secure software is a complex and challenging task. 
Solution: research ways to defend against hacking, malware, phishing, insider and third-party threats

Software Accessibility and Usability - Overly complex software can frustrate or confuse users. 
Solution: Use scalable architecture, Emphasize reliability.

8.Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing- This is the testing of individual components or modules of software.
Importance: Identifies bugs early, improves code quality, and facilitates refactoring.

Integration testing  - Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
Importance: Verifies data flow, interface compatibility, and system integration.

System testing -Focus on the entire software system as a whole, including all functionalities and interactions.
Importance: It help to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, usability, and security .

Acceptance testing - Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
Importance: Ensures user satisfaction and readiness for deployment.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

1.Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining input prompts to guide generative AI models towards desired and accurate outputs.It involves crafting questions that are clear,specific and contextually relevant.
Importance:
Improved user experience - Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language models’ training data.

Increased flexibility - A prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.

Developer control - Prompt engineering gives developers more control over users' interactions with the AI. Effective prompts provide intent and establish context to the large language models. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise.

2.Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Tell me about the human brain.

Provide a concise overview of the human brain's primary structures (cerebrum, cerebellum, brainstem) and their respective functions, suitable for a high school biology student.

REASONS AS TO WHY THE IMPROVED PROMPT IS MORE EFFECTIVE:
It clearly states the desired output: an "overview."
It specifies the "primary structures" (cerebrum, cerebellum, brainstem), focusing the response.
It provides context by indicating the intended audience ("high school biology student"), influencing the level of detail and language used.
It avoids unnecessary words and focuses on the essential information.
It asks for a description of the brain's primary structures and their functions. This is a common and realistic request when discussing the brain.
